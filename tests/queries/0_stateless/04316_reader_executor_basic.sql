-- The activation check below asserts the executor path was taken. On
-- object-storage storage policies the data is on S3, where DiskObjectStorage
-- reads use the threadpool async prefetch stage and the executor falls back, so
-- the assertion only holds on local disk (object-storage routing is covered by
-- the ReadPipelineExecutorTest gtest).

-- Basic smoke test for the experimental ReaderExecutor read path.
-- Reads a local MergeTree table with `use_reader_executor = 1`, checks the data
-- comes back correct (full scan, point lookup, range, string column), and proves
-- the executor path was actually taken via `system.text_log`.
